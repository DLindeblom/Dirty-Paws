# User Stories

#### User stories allow you to draft the high-level requirements based on the user needs. It should describe the interaction of the user and the app.

As a user, I can register an account/profile with my personal details.  
As a user, I can edit my account/profile.  
As a user, I can earn Treats(integer) and badges in various ways
As a user, I can view other profiles and request a match or Reject them.
As a user, I can view and send messages with my matched users
As a user, I can unmatch with my matched users

#### STRETCH:

- As a user, I can use Spotify together with my matched users  
  - see what they're listening to
  - Play a song inside the chat
- As a user, I am more likely to see profiles with a similar number of treats(and badges?)
- As a user, I can set a radius to only see profiles within a certain distances
- As a user, I can video chat with my matched users
- As a user, I can use my Google account to register (purely to flex the API)
